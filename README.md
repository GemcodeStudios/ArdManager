# ArdManager
Arduino Example Projects for use with ArdManager Android App

This respository contains a selection of Arduino sketches to demonstrate the use of ArdManager Android App. 

All Arduino hardware projects will require a Bluetooth shield. The projects have been tested with the HC-05, althouth it should also work with HC-06 device.

ArdManager can be used to control various devices connected to any microcontroller. Arduino is a popular and easy to use microcontroller with plenty of resources available online. ArdManager can also be used to monitor sensor data from the microcontroller. Upto four sensors can be monitored by sending appropriate serial communication string headers to ArdManager. The Temperature and Humidity example shows how to do this. 

ArdManager Pro provides some additional features not available in the free version such as audible alerts, saving chart data to file and no adverts. The Nurse Call Bell sketch is an example on how to send an audio alert to the mobile device.
